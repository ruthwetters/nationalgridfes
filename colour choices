I tried to use palette generators, but did not find one that could generate 18 colours. I therefore started from a base palette and tweaked the hue and saturation to indicate relatedness, e.g. shades of green for organic materials, blue for hydroelectricity, red for storage, purple for incineration and advanced technologies. I assigned yellow to solar and pink to wind, as these are both highly represented and not related to each other or other technologies. I found colour a very difficult issue to work with, due to the number of technologies and the potential to create associations.
